To clarify :
I (KiroTheBlueFox (which is my Minecraft username)) own this tool and its code, but the code it generates is owned by the person who did the models you used.

Be Careful !
There are 2 different versions of the tool !
One version is for Minecraft 1.12.x.
The other is for Minecraft 1.14.x.

Information : I recommend having python 3.7 installed to launch it.

What's coming in the future ?
 - Presets of rotations and all such as : Stairs, Vertical Stairs, Slabs, Vertical Slabs, and more (requests are welcomed).
 - Visualization of how is the block rotated.
